# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a program that is going to better prepare and train customers for there driving test. It would have packages from courses to choose from and would also include tests and a online UI/UX that would show the users progress through each course and appointments scheduled, etc. The client was the owner Liam, the DriverPass owner. They wanted me to create a web based- cloud based system that was online.

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I did particularly well in understand what was needed and what needed to be done. Getting the proper information and feedback from the client and users was also another task I did particularly well on.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to improve on my diagrams. I would make sure I get all the proper parts of each diagram in place and improve my flow. I feel that I need to learn more about it, practice and make sure it is a almost perfect chart for everyone to understand.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted their needs and implemented them into the design with care and understanding of the user and system itself. For example, when Liam mentioned that he wanted it accessible online and offline, I knew it would pose as issue and we had to let him know we could only do online as it would cause data duplication and issues. It is very important to consider users needs when designing because you are creating a project for the user, based on the users. It must fulfill the users needs and if not, it could cause alot of problems, time, and money when changes are asked for.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I appoach desiging a software with more patience and studying of requirements and the software. The techniques and strategies I would use in the future to analyze and design a system would be the many of the interviewing strategies to gain knowlege of the sytem needed such as the 1on1, group interviews, and JAAR.
